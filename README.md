# Introduction to deep reinforcement learning

Contact: shaheer.saeed.17@ucl.ac.uk

This repository contains code for the COMP0090 guest lecture on reinforcement learning.

We present three examples of simple reinforcement learning (RL) problems:

1) `solving_cartpole.py`: This script contains code to solve cartpole using the RL package stable-baselines.
2) `path_selection_env.py`: This script contains code to build and solve a simple path selection game, using the gym and stable-baselines packages respectively.
3) `guessing_game_env.py`: This script contains code to build and solve a simple guessing game, using the gym and stable-baselines packages respectively (the environment in this script is adapted from [an open-source implementation](https://github.com/JKCooper2/gym-envs/blob/master/GuessingGame/guessing_game.py)).

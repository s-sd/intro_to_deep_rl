This repository contains code for the COMP0090 guest lecture on reinforcement learning.

We present three examples of simple reinforcement leanring (RL) problems:

1) `solving_cartpole.py`: This script contians code to solve cartpole using the RL package stbale-baselines.
2) `path_selection_env.py`: This script contains code to build and solve a simple path selection game, using the gym and stable-baselines packages respectively.
3) `guessing_game_env.py`: This script contains code to build and solve a simple guessing game, using the gym and stable-baselines packages respectively.
